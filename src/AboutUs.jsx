          The <strong>LGU-Daet Scholarship Program</strong> is a dedicated
          initiative by the Local Government Unit of Daet aimed at empowering
          deserving students by providing financial assistance of PHP 5,000 per
          semester. The program plays a vital role in promoting access to
          education for underprivileged yet talented individuals. Each school
          year, an examination is conducted to identify new applicants, with
          the number of slots determined by the graduates from the previous
          year and the available funds allocated by the municipal mayor. The
          program currently supports 1,025 scholars, demonstrating its
          significant contribution to the educational advancement and social
          development of the municipality.
